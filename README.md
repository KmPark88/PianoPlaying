This repository provides the **minimal de-identified dataset** and **analysis code** required to reproduce the key results reported in the manuscript, including **Fig. 5** and **Table VII**. The project analyzes fNIRS data from musicians during **score-playing (Task A)** and **motif improvisation (Task B)** using an **LSTM Autoencoder** (LSTM-AE) to derive reconstruction-errorâ€“based indices of neural activity, with a focus on **BA45 (IFG triangularis; channels 1 & 15)**.
